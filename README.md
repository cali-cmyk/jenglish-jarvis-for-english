# Jenglish-Jarvis for English

**Jenglish-Jarvis** is going to be an open source document analyzer, that helps users better their English writing skills to pass exams or generally upgrade their language.  
It is currently equipped with an ugly frontend using **PySide6** and a somewhat working **gemma3:1b** to analyze the document.  
Since the current release is comparable to a pre-alpha or alpha, the documentation **AND** the project is still a work in progress.
