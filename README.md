# Jenglish-Jarvis for English

**Jenglish-Jarvis** is going to be a local open source document analyzer, that helps users better their English writing skills to pass exams or generally upgrade their language.  
It is currently equipped with an ugly frontend using **PySide6** and a somewhat working **gemma3:1b** to analyze the document.  
Since the current release is comparable to a pre-alpha or alpha, the documentation **AND** the project is still a work in progress.
